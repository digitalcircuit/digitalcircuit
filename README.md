## About Me

'ello!  I'm Shane Synan (aka digitalcircuit).  When I'm not learning something new, I usually write code in C++, C#, or Python, following my passion for the open source community.

You may know me from my contributions to these projects:

* [üó®Ô∏è New features and fixes to Quassel IRC](https://quassel-irc.org/ ) (C++/Qt)
* [#Ô∏è‚É£ Collaboration within the global IRCv3 ecosystem](https://ircv3.net/ )
* [ü§ñ Automated Salt Linux deployment of Quassel IRC + Web + Search](https://github.com/digitalcircuit/salt-box-quassel ) (Salt YAML, Bash)
* [üêò Automated Salt Linux deployment of a Mastodon social media instance](https://github.com/digitalcircuit/salt-mastodon ) (Salt YAML, Bash)
* [üì∂ Linux kernel debugging and regression tracking for OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/ ) (C++, Bash)
* [üê¨ New firmware features for the Flipper Zero, e.g. battery charge limiting](https://flipperzero.one/ ) (C++)
* [üí° Actinic music-driven light controller](https://github.com/digitalcircuit/actinic) (C#) with [accompanying ActinicArduino firmware](https://github.com/digitalcircuit/ActinicArduino ) (C++)
* üõ† Smaller fixes to projects such as [And√∫ril 2](https://launchpad.net/flashlight-firmware ), [Bitlbee](https://www.bitlbee.org/ ), [InspIRCd](https://www.inspircd.org/ ), [Podman](https://podman.io/ ), [UnrealIRCd](https://www.unrealircd.org/ ), etc.

Occasionally I'll post about random technology investigations, such as [ecobee thermostat inaccuracies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecobee/comments/yjx8nw/heads_up_ecobee_misreads_temperature_wnearby/ ) or [fixing EasyAntiCheat on Linux](https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/question/0D54z00008mv43YCAQ/eos-sdks-64bit-linux-anticheat-module-fails-under-proton-with-unexpected-error-1-yet-32bit-linux-module-works-fine-on-same-system?language=en_US ).
